# tinyPEPPER2 -- a tiny and lightweight 4in1 BLHeli_S ESC -- 2S edition

My approach to build a small and lightweight ESC.

See [http://fishpepper.de/projects/tinyPEPPER2](http://fishpepper.de/projects/tinyPEPPER2) for more details.

As [my previous tinyPEPPER 1S design](http://fishpepper.de/projects/tinyPEPPER), this thing is TINY as well! The outer dimensions are 20x20mm with a 16mm hole-to-hole spacing.
Of course it also runs BLHELI_S.

Key features:
- 16x16mm hole-to-hole spacing
- 1.4g (!)
- BLHeli_S with DSHOT300
- 1S or 2S operation
- 4.8 A continous current

# Build your own

Make sure to init the git submodule for the libraries in the
kicad_misc directory by calling git submodule init && git submodule update.
You will have to use a recent kicad version, i used the commit #efdfaeb
when i designed this circuit board. Older versions will probably not work.
